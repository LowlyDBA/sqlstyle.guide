## Purpose

This guide is an offshoot of the SQL style guide by Simon Holywell, which is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Based on a work at [http://www.sqlstyle.guide](http://www.sqlstyle.guide). In accordance with the original work, this version is under the same license. 

The T-SQL Style Guide has been adapted as needed for T-SQL specific functionality, best practices, and occasionally opinions of the author. Much like Simon's version, many areas are merely suggestions as there will always be outside factors impacting T-SQL development and design. 

## General

The guide is written in [Markdown][md-lang] and uses [Jekyll][jekyll] via
[GitHub's Pages][gh-pages] facility to render itself upon pushing to the `gh-pages`
branch.
